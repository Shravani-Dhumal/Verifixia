# intentionally left commented out here to avoid long or failing installs.
# Install PyTorch separately following the official instructions for your
# platform. For many macOS/Linux CPU-only setups you can run:
#   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
#   python3 -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch torchvision
# For GPUs or other platforms, follow: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

# torchvision
